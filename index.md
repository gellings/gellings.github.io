## Gary Ellingson, Ph.D. Candidate in Roboitcs at Brigham Young University

Hi there! I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in the Multiple AGent Intelligent Coordination and Control ([MAGICC](https://magicc.byu.edu/)) Lab at Brigham Young University, advised by Prof. Tim McLain. My research interests include flying robotics, state estimation, computer vision and machine learning.

I'm originally from Mesa, Arizona. In my spare time I can often be found flying RC planes, cycling, or playing with my daughters.
